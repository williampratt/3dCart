# 3dCart
Ruby interface to the 3dCart REST APi

# Where is the code?
I'm currently working with the api team and the CTO at 3dCart to fix some issues that need to be overcome. Once this is done, I will update / refactor and release. If you MUST have something NOW, message me. I do have a working prototype that works around the current limitations of the api and database design that plagues 3dCart migrations, etc.
