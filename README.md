# 3dCart
Ruby interface to the 3dCart REST APi

# Where is the code?
I'm currently working with the api team and the CTO at 3dCart to fix some issues that need to be overcome. Once this is done, I will update / refactor and release. If you MUST have something NOW, message me. I do have a working prototype that works around the current limitations of the api and database design that plagues 3dCart migrations, etc.

Also, if you wish to migrate from OsCommerce and want better integration than cart2cart provides, please message me. I have code that can do the initial migration in less than 1/2 a day (3dCart throttles requests) and can do the final sync in a matter of an hour or 2.
